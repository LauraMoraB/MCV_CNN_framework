# Faster R-CNN

[Faster R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01497.pdf) appeared in 2015, after [R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.2524.pdf) and [Fast R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.08083), previous architecutures that have a decoupled approach for region proposal, both using Selective Search ([SS](http://www.huppelen.nl/publications/selectiveSearchDraft.pdf)), and detection networks. Faster R-CNN improves the performance by replacing the Region Proposal Network (RPN) to a CNN, usually VGG, which is shared with the detection network. With SS the obtain mAP is 65,7 whereas using a CNN as RPN increases to 75.9 in Pascal VOC 2012.

In this sense, the input image is fed into the CNN to generate the feature map. To obtain the bounding boxes, a sliding window approach is used in RPN for each location in the features map. As regions can be highly overlapped with each other, non-maximum suppression (NMS) is used to reduce the number of proposals. The Detection network is similar to the previous architectures. It uses a ROI pooling layer to reshape the bounding boxes to a fix size. Then, the pooled area is fed to the CNN and the final feature vector connects to the FC layers and then the SoftMax classification and bounding box regression is finally applied.
