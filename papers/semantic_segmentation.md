# Semantic Segmentation

The implemented networks can be found in ```models/networks/segmentation/```:

- [FCN8](papers/FCN.md)
- [SEGNET](papers/SEGNET.md)

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Task1: Analyse Datasets: Camvid, CityScapes, Kitti
- [x] Task1: Train FCN8 with Camvid
- [x] Task2: Read papers [FCN8](papers/FCN.md) and [SEGNET](papers/SEGNET.md)
- [x] Task3: Train SegNet with Camvid: using pretrained VGG16
- [x] Task4: Train FCN8 and SegNet for: Synthis-CityScapes and Kitti
- [x] Task5: Boost performance in both Networks
- [x] Task6: [Report](../README.md#Report) and Slides

## Results

The following table shows the results obtained from the different tasks. We have used two networks, the Fully Convolutional Network **FCN8** and our implementation of the **SegNet**. The experiments have been done using the following datasets: [CAamvid](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/VideoRec/CamVid/), [Synthia-CityScapes](http://synthia-dataset.net/) and [KITTI](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/).
